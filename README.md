# Face Mask Detection System using CNN

This project is an Image Processing application focused on detecting face masks on objects using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It utilizes TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV to create a robust and efficient mask detection system.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: The system is built using TensorFlow for training a CNN model to detect face masks on objects. This enables accurate and reliable detection of mask-wearing individuals in real-time.

- **Integration with OpenCV**: TensorFlow seamlessly integrates with OpenCV to ensure precise object detection. OpenCV is used for capturing real-time video from a webcam, allowing for efficient face mask detection.

- **Keras API**: Keras serves as an API for TensorFlow, providing a user-friendly interface for building, training, and deploying deep learning models. Its integration ensures accuracy and efficiency in tracking mask-wearing persons.

- **Real-time Detection**: The system can process live video streams from a webcam, annotating the output frames with labels to indicate the presence or absence of face masks.

## Usage

1. **Setup**: Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Dependencies Installation**: Install the required dependencies, including TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV, using the provided requirements file.

3. **Model Training**: Train the CNN model using TensorFlow on a dataset of images containing individuals wearing and not wearing face masks.

4. **Real-time Detection**: Run the main script to capture video from the webcam and perform real-time face mask detection.
